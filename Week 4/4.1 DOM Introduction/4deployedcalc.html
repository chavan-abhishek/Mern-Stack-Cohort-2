       <!-- any time the button is clicked,its goes int the function populateDiv and i get the value a and b in
         the currentinput boxes and i sent request to the https://sum-server.100xdevs.com/sum?a="+ a + "&b=" + b

         How do i get the final response in a variable so i can out it here the div(final sum)
       -->



       <!-- This whole logic was not written on the frontend, i send a request to the backend, backend did the calculation
    backend responded with the final answer -->
    <!-- checkout axios library which is used to send request to a backend and get directly the output-->
